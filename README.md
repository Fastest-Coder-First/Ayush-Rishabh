## Github Copilot
GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant, played a significant role in the development of the Finance Tracker application. 
By leveraging the power of machine learning, GitHub Copilot provided intelligent code suggestions and helped streamline the coding process. 
Here are some ways GitHub Copilot contributed to building this app:

1. Code Generation
  GitHub Copilot helped generate boilerplate code for many sections of the programme, including server routes, database queries, and user interface components. It saved time by generating code snippets depending on the context and needs.
  The development process became more efficient with Copilot's support, reducing the requirement for hand coding from start.

2. Syntax and Error Correction
   GitHub Copilot proved invaluable in catching syntax errors and offering suggestions to correct them.
   By analyzing the code context, it provided real-time feedback to prevent common mistakes, typos, or missing parentheses.
   This helped improve code quality and reduced the debugging time, allowing me to focus more on implementing the application logic.

3. smart auto-completion
   GitHub The auto-completion features of Copilot were quite helpful in expediting the development process.
   It suggested clever variable names, function arguments, and method calls.
   I was able to develop code faster and maintain consistency throughout the programme by implementing their advice.
